Introduction
============

This product was created to help you remove nasty local persistent utilities that won't go away
and destroy your instance when you try to remove a product that registered one.

Just append '/@@fix-persistent-utilities' onto your plone site root.


WARNING!!!
----------

You can really screw up things if you do this wrong so use with extreme care and backup your instance
before you use it.

I will not take responsibility if you misuse this tool...
